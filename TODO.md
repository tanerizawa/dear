# TODO / Future Improvements

This document lists outstanding tasks and ideas for future development. Feel free to pick up any of these items or suggest new ones via issues or pull requests.

- Implement navigation from the Home screen journal list to a detail screen so entries can be viewed individually.
- Add additional DASS and MBTI questions in [`TestData.kt`](app/src/main/java/com/psy/dear/data/static/TestData.kt) to provide more comprehensive assessments.
- Provide a `requirements.txt` for the backend along with setup instructions so the API can be run independently.
- Expand unit and UI test coverage for both the Android app and the backend.
- Remove any leftover shell prompt lines in existing files.
- Document environment variables for the new AI chat features in the README.
